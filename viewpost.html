                        Bulgaria's pleasingly laid-back capital is often overlooked by visitors
                        heading straight to the coast or the ski resorts, but they're missing
                        something special. Sofia is no grand metropolis, but it's a largely
                        modern, youthful city, with a scattering of onion-domed churches,
                        Ottoman mosques and stubborn Red Army monuments that lend an eclectic,
                        exotic feel. Recent excavation work carried out during construction of
                        the city’s metro unveiled a treasure trove of Roman ruins from nearly
                        2000 years ago, when the city was called 'Serdica'. Away from the
                        buildings and boulevards, vast parks and manicured gardens offer a
                        welcome respite, and the ski slopes and hiking trails of mighty Mt
                        Vitosha are just a short bus ride from the centre. Home to many of
                        Bulgaria's finest museums, galleries, restaurants and clubs, Sofia may
                        persuade you to stick around and explore further. Sofia was founded
                        2,500 years ago. Over the centuries, it has been given several names -
                        Serdica , Sredetz and the remains of the old cities can still be viewed
                        today. Because of its strategic location in the middle of Balkans for a
                        while it had been selected for a new capital of the Roman Empire. Near
                        Sofia is the Boyana church, one of the most valuable memorials of Bulgarian
                        and European culture. The church has frescoes, acclaimed by specialists as
                        “the best examples of Eastern medieval art during its twelve century history”.
                        The decline of Sofia during the Turkish Ottoman Empire was followed by the
                        rejuvenation after the Russian liberation in 1878, when Sofia was chosen
                        as the capital of Bulgaria at the First National Constituent Assembly, and
                        followed by a brisk and straight-forward period of construction.
